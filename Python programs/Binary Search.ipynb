    "### What is Binary Search Algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary search is a fast search algorithm with run-time complexity of Ο(log n). This search algorithm works on the principle of divide and conquer. For this algorithm to work properly, the data collection should be in the sorted form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary search looks for a particular item by comparing the middle most item of the collection. If a match occurs, then the index of item is returned. If the middle item is greater than the item, then the item is searched in the sub-array to the left of the middle item. Otherwise, the item is searched for in the sub-array to the right of the middle item. This process continues on the sub-array as well until the size of the subarray reduces to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Binary Search Works?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Concept of Binary Search\n",
    "In the binary search algorithm, we can find the element position using the following methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recursive Method\n",
    "- Iterative Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The divide and conquer approach technique is followed by the recursive method. In this method, a function is called itself again and again until it found an element in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "A set of statements is repeated multiple times to find an element's index position in the iterative method. The while loop is used for accomplish this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary search is more effective than the linear search because we don't need to search each list index. The list must be sorted to achieve the binary search algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a step by step implementation of binary search.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a sorted list of elements, and we are looking for the index position of 45.\n",
    "\n",
    "`[12, 24, 32, 39, 45, 50, 54]`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we are setting `two pointers` in our list. One pointer is used to denote the smaller value called `low` and the second pointer is used to denote the highest value called `high`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we calculate the value of the `middle` element in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>mid = (low+high)/2  \n",
    "Here, the low is 0 and the high is 7.  \n",
    "mid = (0+7)/2  \n",
    "mid = 3 (Integer) </code>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we will compare the searched element to the mid index value. In this case, 32 is not equal to 45. So we need to do further comparison to find the element.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the number we are searching equal to the mid. Then return mid otherwise move to the further comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number to be search is greater than the middle number, we compare the n with the middle element of the elements on the right side of mid and set low to\n",
    "\n",
    "`low = mid + 1.`\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, compare the n with the middle element of the elements on the left side of mid and set high to\n",
    "\n",
    "`high = mid - 1.`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Divide and conquer techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compare x with the middle element. \n",
    "2. If x matches with the middle element, we return the middle index. \n",
    "3. Else If x is greater than the middle element, then x can only lie in the right half of the subarray after the middle element. So we choose the right subarray \n",
    "4. Else (x is smaller) we choose the left subarray. \n",
    "\n",
    "`[10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100,110,120,130,140,150,160]`\n",
    "\n",
    "`[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Low= 0; high=mid-1; =3-1=2; keyvalue=10;\n",
    "\n",
    "// more than one element, apply divided and conquer techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Mid = (0+2)/2 = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Still again, 10 < 20, we need to find the left most subarray i.e., mid-1;\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "Low=0; high=mid-1 = 1-1 =0; keyvalue=10;\n",
    "\n",
    "No need to apply divide and conquer techniques, directly apply first part of the algorithm \n",
